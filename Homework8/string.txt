See Jane and Mary run up the hill
Jerry and Mike run quickly to the mill
See Aplin and Peters listen to some music
Apple and Person listen same music
Cause I heard your friend say that I am the best thing
Because I hear you are friend sae that I the best thing
Now you wanna be friends always sad on weekends
no you want to be friends always say on week end
Who gave it all and help you up
who give it oh and help you up
It is your bed bae it is your funeral
it is your bed bae it is your funeral
And you are giving sips of your whiskey to somebody new
And you are giving sips of you whiskey to somebody new
THE DOG WANTS TO PLAY BALL
THE CAT LOVES TO PLAY
